# Multiple Linear Regression (Startups) — Embedded Inference

This folder contains an embedded-C inference implementation for the Multiple
Linear Regression model trained in Python on the Udemy 50_Startups dataset.

## Model form
Profit = intercept + sum_i (coef[i] * x[i])

The auto-generated coefficients and feature ordering are stored in:
- `model_coeffs_autogen.h`

Inference function:
- `inference.c` → `mlr_predict_profit(const double x[MLR_NUM_FEATURES])`

## Input vector ordering (IMPORTANT)
Your input array `x[]` must follow the same order as `MLR_FEATURE_NAMES`:

1. R&D Spend
2. Administration
3. Marketing Spend
4. State_California (0 or 1)
5. State_Florida (0 or 1)
6. State_New York (0 or 1)

Exactly one of the State_* entries should be 1 for a valid single-state input.

## Notes
- This example uses `double` for simplicity. On MCU targets, use `float` or
  fixed-point depending on available FPU and precision requirements.
- The header is generated by the Python training pipeline
  (`src/mlaz/pipeline/train_multiple_linear.py`).
